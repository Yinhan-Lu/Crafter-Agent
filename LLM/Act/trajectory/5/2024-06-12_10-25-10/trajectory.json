Given these assessments, although the termination condition about the furnace being in observation and nearby is partially met (since the furnace isn't placed yet), the resource levels and the absence of zombies or skeletons mean the subtask should continue performing actions according to the plan till the furnace is placed successfully or other conditions change."
