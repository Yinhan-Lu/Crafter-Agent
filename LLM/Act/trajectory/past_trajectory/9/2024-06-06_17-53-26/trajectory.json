Secondly, the skeleton is 27 blocks away to the south-east and is within the consideration of 'nearby.' Thirdly, the inventory does not show an increase in iron. Lastly, energy levels are at 4/9, which is not critically low, but not optimal for continued physical activity. Despite the inventory not containing iron and energy being at moderate levels, the proximity of the skeleton and the onset of nighttime justify meeting at least one termination condition: the presence of a hostile entity nearby.
