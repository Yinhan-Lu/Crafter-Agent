Although this move requires careful navigation in subsequent steps to avoid immediate water obstacles, it aligns most efficiently with the subtask goal of collecting wood from the tree while maintaining the optimal progress towards it..",
            "At timestep 14, you observed State description: \n- East: grass(1 blocks away), stone(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(5 blocks away).\n- North: grass(1 blocks away), unexplored_area(5 blocks away).\n- North East: grass(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(6 blocks away).\n- North West: grass(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(6 blocks away).\n- South: water(1 blocks away), grass(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(4 blocks away).\n- South East: water(2 blocks away), grass(3 blocks away), unexplored_area(5 blocks away).\n- South West: water(2 blocks away), tree,grass(3 blocks away), unexplored_area(5 blocks away).\n- West: stone(1 blocks away), grass(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(8 blocks away).\nClosest:\n- stone: West 1 blocks away   (objects in between: None) \n- water: South 1 blocks away   (objects in between: None) \n- tree: South West 3 blocks away   (objects in between: {'water', 'grass'}) \n- Facing water on the south.\nYour status:\n- health: 9/9\n- food: 9/9\n- drink: 9/9\n- energy: 9/9\nYou have nothing in your inventory. and selected move_east because Moving east is the optimal action as it places you on a walkable grass block, keeps you safe from immediate obstacles, and moves you strategically closer to the tree while maintaining walkability. This aligns well with the plan for gradually approaching the tree for wood collection while providing flexibility for avoiding obstacles in the environment..",
            "At timestep 15, you observed State description: \n- East: stone(1 blocks away), grass(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(5 blocks away).\n- North: grass(1 blocks away), unexplored_area(5 blocks away).\n- North East: grass(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(6 blocks away).\n- North West: grass(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(6 blocks away).\n- South: water(1 blocks away), grass(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(4 blocks away).\n- South East: grass(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(5 blocks away).\n- South West: water(2 blocks away), tree,grass(3 blocks away), unexplored_area(5 blocks away).\n- West: grass(1 blocks away), stone(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(9 blocks away).\nClosest:\n- stone: East 1 blocks away   (objects in between: None) \n- water: South 1 blocks away   (objects in between: None) \n- tree: South West 4 blocks away   (objects in between: {'water', 'grass'}) \n- Facing stone on the east.\nYour status:\n- health: 9/9\n- food: 9/9\n- drink: 9/9\n- energy: 9/9\nYou have nothing in your inventory. and selected move_west because The best action to execute is 'move_west'. This action positions you closer to the subtask-related objects (stone and tree) while avoiding the immediate water hazard. Although a detour around the stone is required, it provides a safer approach towards the tree for wood collection and allows for better strategizing in future movements with consideration to the environment dynamics..",
            "At timestep 16, you observed State description: \n- East: grass(1 blocks away), stone(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(6 blocks away).\n- North: grass(1 blocks away), unexplored_area(5 blocks away).\n- North East: grass(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(6 blocks away).\n- North West: grass(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(6 blocks away).\n- South: water(1 blocks away), grass(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(4 blocks away).\n- South East: water(2 blocks away), grass(3 blocks away), unexplored_area(5 blocks away).\n- South West: water(2 blocks away), tree,grass(3 blocks away), unexplored_area(5 blocks away).\n- West: stone(1 blocks away), grass(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(8 blocks away).\nClosest:\n- stone: West 1 blocks away   (objects in between: None) \n- water: South 1 blocks away   (objects in between: None) \n- tree: South West 3 blocks away   (objects in between: {'water', 'grass'}) \n- Facing stone on the west.\nYour status:\n- health: 9/9\n- food: 9/9\n- drink: 9/9\n- energy: 9/9\nYou have nothing in your inventory. and selected face_south_obstructed_by_water because Facing south, even though obstructed by water, is the best action as it aligns your position to directly face the nearest tree. This strategic orientation sets up better planning for subsequent movements. It prepares you to navigate around or strategize bypassing water obstacles efficiently, while keeping focus on approaching the tree for wood collection, remaining aligned to the subtask goal..",
            "At timestep 17, you observed State description: \n- East: grass(1 blocks away), stone(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(6 blocks away).\n- North: grass(1 blocks away), unexplored_area(5 blocks away).\n- North East: grass(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(6 blocks away).\n- North West: grass(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(6 blocks away).\n- South: water(1 blocks away), grass(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(4 blocks away).\n- South East: water(2 blocks away), grass(3 blocks away), unexplored_area(5 blocks away).\n- South West: water(2 blocks away), tree,grass(3 blocks away), unexplored_area(5 blocks away).\n- West: stone(1 blocks away), grass(2 blocks away), unexplored_area(8 blocks away).\nClosest:\n- stone: West 1 blocks away   (objects in between: None) \n- water: South 1 blocks away   (objects in between: None) \n- tree: South West 3 blocks away   (objects in between: {'water', 'grass'}) \n- Facing water on the south.\nYour status:\n- health: 9/9\n- food: 9/9\n- drink: 9/9\n- energy: 9/9\nYou have nothing in your inventory. and selected move_north because The best action to execute next is 'move_north' because it maintains your safety on walkable grass terrain while avoiding immediate water obstacles. Although it does not immediately bring you closer to the tree, it allows for potential exploration of new resources and areas that might provide better options for approaching the tree. This strategy ensures sustained progress and safety in a dynamic environment while potentially opening up new avenues for strategic movements.."
